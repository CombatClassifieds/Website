## Prerequisites

First, install all the node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Frontend

To get the build server running for the frontend, just type:

```bash
npm run dev:client
```

This should open a running vite process, which tells you where the frontend is hosted
(usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Using Tailwind

There are a few ways you can use tailwind, but the most productive workflow involves using the
`@apply` keyword in `client/app.css` to apply specific
[tailwind rules](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-weight).
