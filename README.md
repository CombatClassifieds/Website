# Combat Classifieds

## Prerequisites

First, install all the node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Frontend

To get the build server running for the frontend, just type:

```bash
npm run dev:client
```

This should open a running vite process, which tells you where the frontend is hosted
(usually `http://localhost:5173`).
